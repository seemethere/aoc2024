# aoc2024, Advent of Code 2024

This is my feeble attempt to do the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2024 challenge using rust, a language that I am currently not proficient with.

My goal for this repository is just to document me learning rust and attempting to get better at it as I write more.

I also want to speed up my development cycle by adding in tests where possible.

> [!NOTE] 
> I am not very good at rust, so don't take anything in this repository as how you should write rust, this is rust from the lens of a python programmer.
